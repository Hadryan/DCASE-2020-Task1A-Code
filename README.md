    abstract = "This technical report describes the ADSPLAB teamâ€™s submission for Task1 of DCASE2020 challenge. Our acoustic scene classifi- cation (ASC) system is based on the convolutional neural networks (CNN). Multiple decision schemes are proposed in our system, in- cluding the decision schemes in multiple representations, multiple frequency bands, and multiple temporal frames. The final system is the fusion of models with multiple decision schemes and mod- els pre-trained on AudioSet. The experimental results show that our system could achieve the accuracy of 84.5 \%(official baseline: 54.1\%) and 92.1\% (official baseline: 87.3\%) on the officially provided fold 1 evaluation dataset of Task1A and Task1B, respectively."
